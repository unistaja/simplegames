Pressing any key will create a smiley or a star that will bounce around the screen/against each other.

Holding down any key will make a rocket rise towards the moon. Once rocket reaches the moon, the moon will turn into a smiley and a beep will sound. Rocket will fall back down if no key is pressed.

A yellow star will follow the curson on the screen, and a small blue star will jump to a random location if hit with the yellow star.
